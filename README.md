# Virtual-Electronic-Troubleshooting-Assistant
The Virtual Electronic Troubleshooting Assistant is an AI-powered Streamlit app that enables users to upload technical PDFs and query them via a natural language chat. Built with LangChain, Hugging Face, Pinecone and hybrid search (BM25 + embeddings), it provides accurate, context-aware responses from uploaded documents.
